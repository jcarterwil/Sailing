# Sailing — agent guide

A sailing race-performance app: racers upload GPS tracking data (Vakaros `.vkx` / CSV), replay the race on a map, and generate a coach report ("Race Dossier"). Next.js 16 App Router + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui, on Supabase (Auth + Postgres + Storage) and Vercel.

Directory-specific guides exist — read the `AGENTS.md` nearest the code you touch:
- `src/lib/analytics/AGENTS.md` — parsers, wind/maneuver algorithms, angle conventions
- `src/components/replay/AGENTS.md` — map + 60fps playback architecture
- `supabase/AGENTS.md` — schema, RLS idioms, how migrations reach the database

## Golden rules

1. **Read the Next.js 16 docs before writing framework code.** Request interception is `src/proxy.ts` (the renamed `middleware.ts`). Data pages use `export const dynamic = "force-dynamic"`; route handlers take `params: Promise<{…}>`. Confirm conventions in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` rather than from memory.
2. **CI is the build/test gate — let it run.** GitHub Actions runs `npm run verify` (lint → typecheck → test → build) on every PR and on push to `main`; that check is authoritative. Locally, run the fast, reliable pieces — `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and the `npm run test` cases relevant to your change. **Don't gate your work on a full local production `build`, especially in constrained or cloud sandboxes where it's flaky — push and let CI build/test**, then fix whatever it flags. (The `build` step needs real time and memory; a wobbly sandbox is the wrong place to run it.)
3. **Surgical changes only.** Match surrounding style; touch only what the task needs; don't refactor adjacent code.
4. **Never put a secret in a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variable.** The service-role key (`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`) is server-only via `src/lib/supabase/admin.ts` (`import "server-only"`). Client and server components use the publishable key.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Dev server at http://localhost:3000 |
| `npm run verify` | **Pre-PR gate:** lint, typecheck, test, build |
| `npm run test` | Vitest (analytics golden tests) |
| `npm run db:push` | Apply pending migrations to the linked Supabase project |
| `npm run db:types` | Regenerate `src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` after a schema change |
| `npx tsx scripts/seed-example-race.ts` | Seed the demo race from `Examples/` (idempotent) |

Package manager: npm. Path alias `@/*` → `src/*`. No test runner beyond Vitest (scoped to `src/**/*.test.ts`).

## Repo map

- `src/app` — routes. Auth under `src/app/auth/*`; races under `src/app/races/*`; API route handlers under `src/app/api/*`.
- `src/app/races/actions.ts` — server actions (create/join race, request upload, etc.). Files upload **direct to Storage** via signed URLs — never through a server action (1MB body cap).
- `src/lib/analytics` — pure, dependency-free domain engine (parsers, cleaning, and the wind/maneuver/race algorithms as they land).
- `src/lib/supabase` — three clients: `client.ts` (browser), `server.ts` (RSC/route handlers), `admin.ts` (service role, server-only), plus `proxy.ts` (session refresh).
- `src/components/replay` — the client-only race replay (map, playback, timeline).
- `supabase/migrations` — schema history; `supabase/config.toml` — local/project config.
- `Examples/` — real fleet track files and reference PDFs. **Git-ignored (personal correspondence); never commit.**

## How changes reach production

- **CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `npm run verify` (lint → typecheck → test → build) on every PR and every push to `main`, on **Node 24** with inert placeholder public env vars (no secrets — server secrets are read at request time, not during the build). This is the automated gate; treat a red `verify` as blocking.
- **Branch protection:** `main` is governed by GitHub **rulesets** — every change lands via a PR whose `verify` check passes; contributor PRs also require a code-owner (maintainer) review; the repo owner can self-merge their own PR once CI is green. No direct pushes, force-pushes, or deletion of `main`. **Squash-merge only.**
- **App code:** push to `main` → Vercel builds and deploys automatically. Primary domain `https://sailing-performance.vercel.app`.
- **Database:** the **Supabase GitHub integration** is connected to this repo with *Deploy to production* enabled on `main`. Supabase applies any new `supabase/migrations/` file automatically when it merges to `main` — no CI secrets, no manual step. (Locally you can still run `npm run db:push` to apply immediately.) Migrations must be **additive/backward-compatible** so app and schema can deploy in either order. After changing schema, run `npm run db:types` and commit the regenerated types. See `supabase/AGENTS.md`.

## Pull request flow

1. Get the fast local checks green — `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, and the `npm run test` cases relevant to your change. A clean local production `build` is **not** required; CI runs it (see above).
2. Open the PR against `main`. CI runs `npm run verify`; fix anything it flags that's attributable to your change. Keep changes additive/backward-compatible where they touch the database or shared analytics types.
3. `main`'s rulesets enforce the gate: the `verify` check must pass, and contributor PRs require a code-owner review before merge. The repo owner can self-merge their own PR once CI is green. Squash-merge only — never force-push or push directly to `main`.
4. If an automated code reviewer runs on the PR, address its material findings before merging. Never merge with the `verify` check red.

> **Owner merging your own PR:** the plain `gh pr merge` balks — it reads the global "review required" status and ignores your ruleset bypass. Merge via the GitHub **Merge** button or `gh pr merge <N> --squash --admin` (the server honors your bypass, so this isn't a real admin override).

## Security must-dos (every endpoint and query)

- **RLS on every table**, scoped with the `(select auth.uid())` idiom. New tables follow the pattern in `supabase/migrations`.
- **Anonymous access is server-mediated only.** There are no anon RLS policies; public share pages resolve via the admin client after a slug lookup. Do not add anon policies.
- **The admin (service-role) client bypasses RLS** — every call site must do its own authorization check first (membership, organizer, or admin).
- **Post-auth redirects** go through `getSafeNextPath` (`src/lib/auth/redirect.ts`) — an open-redirect guard.
